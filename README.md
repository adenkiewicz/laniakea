# Laniakea

Chrome plugin that replaces default "New Tab" page with random Flickr picture (based on defined search criteria (tags)).

The intended use case is to have amazing space-themed photos in every new tab, however, you can use any tags you really want.

### Requirements

Flickr API is required. Private API key can be requested on https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html

### Used scripts

* [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
* [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
* [Tether](https://github.com/HubSpot/tether)
* [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify)

### Note

This is more or less private project, feel free to propose improvements, fixes, etc. but I don't promise anything. Also, feel free to fork :)

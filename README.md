# Laniakea

Chrome plugin that replaces default "New Tab" page with random Flickr picture (based on defined search criteria (tags)).

The intended use case is to have amazing space-themed photos in every new tab, however, you can use any tags you really want.

### Requirements

Flickr API is required. Private API key can be requested on https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html

### Used scripts

* [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
* [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
* [Tether](https://github.com/HubSpot/tether)
* [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify)

### Note

The extension is not available through Google Web Store since they ask for $5 payment. I don't see a reason why would I need this. The extension can be installed from local directory or from one of the releases.

This is more or less private project, feel free to propose improvements, fixes, etc. but I don't promise anything. Also, feel free to fork :)
